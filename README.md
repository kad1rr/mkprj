# mkprj (Make Project)
It is a simple CLI that I use in daily life, does not have many details, and creates a simple starter template for some projects.

To use it, you will need an additional script to run the `index.js` file. This script might look like this:

`mkprj.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

bun Your/Mkprj/Path/index.js
````

As I said, it is small and not multifunctional, but it saves my time. Maybe it'll help you too.
